This file follows the Keep a Changelog standard for documenting changes in software projects. The file is organized into three main sections, each with their own sub-sections:

    Unreleased: This section contains changes that have been made to the project but haven't yet been released in a stable version.
    [Version Number]: This section contains changes that were made in a specific version of the project, with a link to the release tag on GitHub.
    Added: This sub-section lists new features or functionality that were added in the version.
    Changed: This sub-section lists any changes that were made to existing features or functionality in the version.
    Removed: This sub-section lists any features or functionality that were removed in the version.

By following this standard, you can keep track of the changes made to your project over time and communicate those changes clearly to other developers and users.
