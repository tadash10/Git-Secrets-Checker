#To add the .travis.yml file to your repository and configure Travis CI to run tests automatically, you can follow these steps:

    Create a .travis.yml file in the root directory of your repository.
    Copy and paste the example configuration provided in my previous message.
    Modify the script directive to run the actual test script for your repository.
    Commit the changes and push them to your repository on GitHub.
    Sign up for an account on Travis CI if you don't already have one.
    Connect Travis CI to your GitHub account and select the repository you want to enable automatic testing for.
    Configure any additional settings or environment variables as needed.
    Trigger a new build on Travis CI to verify that the tests are running successfully.

If you run into any issues, be sure to consult the Travis CI documentation or ask for help from the Travis CI community.
