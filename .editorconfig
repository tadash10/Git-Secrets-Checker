#This .editorconfig file defines consistent coding styles for the Git Secrets Checker repository, including settings for newline characters, whitespace, and indentation. The file is organized into three main sections:

    [*]: This section defines settings for all files in the repository.
    [scripts/**]: This section defines settings for all files in the scripts/ directory.
    [*.sh]: This section defines settings for all shell scripts in the repository.

By using an .editorconfig file, you can help ensure that all contributors to the project are using the same coding styles, regardless of which editor or IDE they are using.
